#Hospital Simulation

<p> This project contains an Event List class that uses a Skip List data structure since the purpose of this project is to essentially compare the running time of linkedlists vs array lists vs skip lists </p> 

<p> In computer science, a skip list is a data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements. Fast search is made possible by maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, each skipping over fewer elements. </p> 
<p> In order to run this project, please run SimulationManager.java </p>
