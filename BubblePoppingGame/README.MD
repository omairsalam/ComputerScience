# Ellen Portia Game 

Arcade Game that consists of bubbles that have to be popped using mouse clicks. The game is designed using timers and clocks and a proper gaming system, the logic of which can be found in score.java. This game makes use of Java Swing API and does not have any external dependencies besides everything in this file (including the .wav file which is the background music). </p> 

<p> Please note that the game starts immediately after the program opens so there is no waiting time there. The user gets 3 lives after which the game ends. As the user clicks on more and more bubbles, the game gets faster and the bubbles start to appear for shorter times thus making the game significantly difficult </p> 



To run, execute <pre> <p> javac EllenPortia.java </p> java EllenPortia </p> </pre>
