In this lab, you will implement the dynamic programming algorithm to solve the matrix chain
multiplication problem as presented in class. Specifically, given a sequence of matrix dimensions (that
are compatible for matrix multiplication in the order given), you will compute the minimum number of
multiplications required to compute the matrix chain product, and you will also produce a sequence of
indices corresponding to where the product “breaks” occur throughout the multiplication.
