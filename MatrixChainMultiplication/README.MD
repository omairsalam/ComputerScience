#Matrix Chain Multiplication

This project implements the dynamic programming algorithm to solve the matrix chain
multiplication problem. Specifically, given a sequence of matrix dimensions (that
are compatible for matrix multiplication in the order given), this algorithm computes the minimum number of
multiplications required to compute the matrix chain product, and also produce a sequence of
indices corresponding to where the product “breaks” occur throughout the multiplication.
